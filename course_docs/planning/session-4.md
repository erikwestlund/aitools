# Session 4: Synthesis and Looking Forward — March 12

*What did we learn, and where do we go from here?*

- 10 min: Lecture — Reproducibility and documentation: organizing AI-assisted projects, documenting workflows, project setup and progress tracking
- 40 min: Moonshot share — Lightning rounds: each student shares their moonshot (~3 min) — what they attempted, what worked, what failed, what surprised them. Class discussion after each.
- 15 min: Discussion — Looking forward: picking models for different tasks, staying current as tools change, where these tools are headed, finding your personal line
- 15 min: Wrap-up — Course retrospective: what was most useful? What do you wish we covered? Feedback for the pilot.
