# Remaining 3 Sessions Plan (Post-Session 1)

## Session 2: Tools Introduction + Session 1 Wrap-Up — February 26

*Quick wrap-up from Session 1, then responsible tool use and one concrete application.*

- 30 min: Session 1 wrap-up block
  - 5 min: Broad-strokes review of model improvement vs. reliability
  - 5 min: Goodhart's Law comment and why benchmark gains can mislead
  - 20 min max: Open ethics discussion (guided prompts)
- 15 min: Responsible use frame for biostatistics (verification, documentation, and PHI guardrails)
- 20 min: Tool landscape — chat prompts, browser/IDE agents, CLI agents, and MCP/context/skills
- 20 min: Visualization-first demo — chatbot workflow, then agent workflow on the same task
- 5 min: Hands-on launch with a verification checklist
- 5 min: Wrap-up — moonshot check-in + one concrete next step per student

**Homework:** Continue moonshot. Bring one reproducible success, one failure, and your verification notes to Session 3.

## Session 3: AI-Assisted Statistical Workflows — March 5

*From prompting to reproducible pipelines under realistic constraints.*

- 10 min: Debrief from moonshot progress (wins and failure modes)
- 20 min: Lecture + demo — context discipline, prompting patterns, and audit trails
- 15 min: Lecture + demo — code-not-data principle, synthetic development loop, Git handoff to secure environments
- 30 min: Hands-on lab — build a mini workflow (cleaning, EDA, simple model) and deliberately stress-test it
- 10 min: Group reflection — where tools helped vs. where they misled
- 5 min: Wrap-up — prep for final synthesis session

**Homework:** Finalize moonshot attempt and prepare a 3-minute informal share.

## Session 4: Synthesis and Looking Forward — March 12

*Consolidate lessons and set practical guardrails for future use.*

- 10 min: Lecture — reproducibility and documentation standards for AI-assisted work
- 40 min: Moonshot lightning shares (~3 min each) with short class feedback
- 15 min: Discussion — personal policy: when to use AI, when to avoid it, what verification is non-negotiable
- 15 min: Course retrospective — what to keep, cut, or expand next offering

**End goal:** Each student leaves with a practical decision framework, not just tool familiarity.
