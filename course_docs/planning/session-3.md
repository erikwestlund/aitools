# Session 3: AI-Assisted Statistical Workflows — March 5

*Doing real work: from prompting to pipelines*

- 15 min: Lecture + demo — Context and prompting: structuring prompts for statistical work, project context files, system prompts, good prompt vs. bad prompt
- 15 min: Lecture + demo — The code-not-data principle in practice. Synthetic data as a development strategy. Git as a bridge between AI-assisted and secure data environments
- 10 min: Lecture — AI for statistical thinking: data cleaning, EDA, visualization, modeling, DAGs and causal assumptions, simulation, model validation — where AI is a thought partner and where it confidently misleads
- 30 min: Hands-on — Build an analysis pipeline on synthetic data using AI tools: cleaning, summary statistics, visualization, a simple model. Audit the output — catch the mistakes.
- 10 min: Wrap-up — Moonshot progress reports. Prepare a 3-minute informal share for next week.

**Homework:** Finish your moonshot attempt. Prepare to share what you tried, what worked, and what didn't (3 minutes, informal, no slides required).
