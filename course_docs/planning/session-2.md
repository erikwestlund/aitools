# Session 2: The Toolbox — February 26

*What's out there, and how do you use it?*

- 10 min: Discussion — Debrief: what happened when you tried a new tool? Surprises?
- 20 min: Lecture + demo — The AI tools: models and model selection, chat windows, autocomplete tools, IDE agents (VS Code, Cursor, RStudio, Positron), CLI agents (Claude Code, etc.), Model Context Protocol
- 15 min: Lecture + demo — The supporting tools: command line basics, tmux for persistent sessions, Git and GitHub, API keys vs. subscriptions, cost management
- 30 min: Hands-on — Get set up with an IDE or CLI agent. Work through a guided exercise: use an integrated tool (not a chat window) to complete a coding task.
- 5 min: Wrap-up — Moonshot check-in

**Homework:** Make progress on your moonshot. Ensure Git is set up and working.
