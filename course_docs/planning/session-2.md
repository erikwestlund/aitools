# Session 2: Tools Introduction — February 26

*What's out there, and how do you use it?*

- 30 min: Session 1 wrap-up block
  - 5 min: Broad-strokes review of model improvement vs. reliability
  - 5 min: Goodhart's Law and benchmark-driven progress
  - 20 min max: Open ethics discussion
- 15 min: Responsible use frame for biostatistics
  - Verification before trust, especially for clinical/public-health claims
  - Documentation expectations (what AI did, what you checked, what changed)
  - Red lines: no PHI in external tools, no unverified model claims in final outputs
- 20 min: Tool landscape — chat prompts, browser/IDE agents, CLI agents, and where each fits
- 20 min: Application demo — visualization-first workflow
  - Start with a chat-based approach: generate and refine one statistical visualization
  - Then show an agent-based pass: same goal, with better context control and iteration
  - Compare tradeoffs: speed, transparency, reproducibility, error detection
- 5 min: Hands-on launch — students reproduce the workflow starter with a checklist
- 5 min: Wrap-up — Moonshot check-in

**Homework:** Apply one AI-assisted visualization or summary workflow to your moonshot. Bring one success, one failure, and your verification steps to Session 3.
