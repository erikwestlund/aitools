## Overview

The only assignment for this course to attempt something ambitious with AI tools and report honestly on what happened.

Pick a task that feels beyond your current ability, or in a domain you know little about, and use AI tools to make a serious attempt at it. You do not need to write a single line of code yourself. You can let the AI write all of it. In fact, I would encourage you to see how far you can go. What I want to see is the attempt, the reflection, and the honest accounting of what worked and what didn't.

## Deliverables

### 1. Topic proposal

**Due: February 26 (before Session 2)**

Email a short description of your proposed moonshot task (a few sentences is fine) to [ewestlund@jhu.edu](mailto:ewestlund@jhu.edu).

### 2. Project and reflection

**Due: March 12 (Session 4)**

Submit your project materials and a written reflection.

**Project materials:** Share via a GitHub repository (preferred) or a zip file emailed to [ewestlund@jhu.edu](mailto:ewestlund@jhu.edu). Include whatever you produced --- code, output, data, notebooks, etc. The project does not need to be finished.

**Written reflection (2--3 pages):** Your reflection must address:

- **What you attempted.** Describe the task and why you chose it.
- **What worked and what didn't.** Be specific. Which parts did AI tools handle well? Where did they fail, mislead, or produce something you couldn't use?
- **How you checked your work.** Explain how you verified that AI-generated output was correct. What strategies did you use? What did you catch? What might you have missed?

### 3. In-class share (Session 4)

During Session 4, each student will give an informal 3-minute summary of their moonshot to the class. No slides required. We will discuss as a group after each share.

The project does not need to be "finished" by Session 4. Incomplete attempts with honest reflection are perfectly acceptable.

## Guidelines

- **No code writing required.** You may let AI tools generate all code. The point is to explore what the tools can and cannot do, not to demonstrate your own coding ability.
- **Honest reporting matters more than success.** A failed attempt with a thoughtful reflection is worth more than a polished result with no critical analysis.
- **Use any AI tools you want.** ChatGPT, Claude, Copilot, Cursor, Claude Code, or anything else. You may use multiple tools and compare them.
- **Document your process.** Save chat logs, screenshots, or session histories where possible. These can support your reflection but are not required as part of the submission.
