Course Title: AI Tools for Data Science and Statistics

Description:
	
As AI tools are rapidly promoted across research and industry, there is a growing need for statisticians and data scientists to understand what these tools are capable of and how to use them responsibly. This course provides practical approaches for integrating large language models and agent-based tools into statistical workflows. Students learn how to structure AI-assisted processes for analysis, simulation, and pipeline development, along with core skills in context management and agent orchestration. The course emphasizes AI safety, privacy, and responsible handling of sensitive data. Students will discuss these topics and do hands-on exercises to test the strengths and weaknesses of AI tools in practice.
