    "text": "Course Description\nAs AI tools are rapidly adopted across research and industry, there is a growing need for statisticians and data scientists to understand what these tools are capable of and how to use them responsibly. This course provides practical approaches for integrating large language models and agent-based tools into statistical workflows. Students learn how to structure AI-assisted processes for analysis, simulation, and pipeline development, along with core skills in context management and agent orchestration. The course emphasizes AI safety, privacy, and responsible handling of sensitive data. Students will discuss these topics and do hands-on exercises to test the strengths and weaknesses of AI tools in practice."

What feels OK, what feels uncomfortable?\n\n\nLecture\n15\nAI ethics and responsible use: privacy and PHI, bias, reproducibility, academic integrity, environmental cost — a framework for reasoning, not a list of rules\n\n\nCase study\n10\nHow this syllabus was built with AI — is that OK? Why or why not?\n\n\nLecture\n15\nWhat is an LLM? Tokens, context windows, temperature, stochasticity. Why the same prompt gives different answers. Model landscape: GPT, Claude, Gemini, DeepSeek\n\n\nHands-on\n20\nEveryone gets the same statistical task; use your own tool; compare results across tools — what worked, what hallucinated?\n\n\nWrap-up\n5\nIntroduce moonshot assignment; tools and subscriptions overview\n\n\n\nHomework: Brainstorm your moonshot task. Try a second AI tool you haven’t used before for a small task and note the differences.\n\n\nSession 2: The Toolbox — February 26\nWhat’s out there, and how do you use it?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlock\nMin\nTopic\n\n\n\n\nDiscussion\n10\nDebrief: what happened when you tried a new tool? Surprises?\n\n\nLecture + demo\n20\nThe AI tools: models and model selection, chat windows, autocomplete tools, IDE agents (VS Code, Cursor, RStudio, Positron), CLI agents (Claude Code, etc.), Model Context Protocol\n\n\nLecture + demo\n15\nThe supporting tools: command line basics, tmux for persistent sessions, Git and GitHub, API keys vs. subscriptions, cost management\n\n\nHands-on\n30\nGet set up with an IDE or CLI agent. Work through a guided exercise: use an integrated tool (not a chat window) to complete a coding task.\n\n\nWrap-up\n5\nMoonshot check-in\n\n\n\nHomework: Make progress on your moonshot. Ensure Git is set up and working.\n\n\nSession 3: AI-Assisted Statistical Workflows — March 5\nDoing real work: from prompting to pipelines\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlock\nMin\nTopic\n\n\n\n\nLecture + demo\n15\nContext and prompting: structuring prompts for statistical work, project context files, system prompts, good prompt vs. bad prompt\n\n\nLecture + demo\n15\nThe code-not-data principle in practice. Synthetic data as a development strategy. Git as a bridge between AI-assisted and secure data environments\n\n\nLecture\n10\nAI for statistical thinking: data cleaning, EDA, visualization, modeling, DAGs and causal assumptions, simulation, model validation — where AI is a thought partner and where it confidently misleads\n\n\nHands-on\n30\nBuild an analysis pipeline on synthetic data using AI tools: cleaning, summary statistics, visualization, a simple model. Audit the output — catch the mistakes.\n\n\nWrap-up\n10\nMoonshot progress reports. Prepare a 3-minute informal share for next week.\n\n\n\nHomework: Finish your moonshot attempt. Prepare to share what you tried, what worked, and what didn’t (3 minutes, informal, no slides required).\n\n\nSession 4: Synthesis and Looking Forward — March 12\nWhat did we learn, and where do we go from here?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlock\nMin\nTopic\n\n\n\n\nLecture\n10\nReproducibility and documentation: organizing AI-assisted projects, documenting workflows, project setup and progress tracking\n\n\nMoonshot share\n40\nLightning rounds: each student shares their moonshot (~3 min) — what they attempted, what worked, what failed, what surprised them. Class discussion after each.\n\n\nDiscussion\n15\nLooking forward: picking models for different tasks, staying current as tools change, where these tools are headed, finding your personal line\n\n\nWrap-up\n15\nCourse retrospective: what was most useful? What do you wish we covered? Feedback for the pilot."
